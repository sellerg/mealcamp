        <p>
          Letâ€™s kick things off by discussing the <b>biggest challenges</b> you
          all face when it comes to working out.
        </p>
        <img src={mandssurvey} alt="survey graph" />
        <p>
          According to the <b>2017 M&amp;S Fitness Survey,</b> the number one
          challenge of those who took the survey was maintaining a diet that
          helped them reach their goals. I found this interesting. Further down
          in their results article, I learnt that nearly 71% of people who took
          their survey create their own diet plans.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, if 71% of people are creating their own diets and another 43% are
          finding it difficult to maintain a proper diet, the fitness industry
          must find a way to make it easier for you guys to adopt and maintain a
          diet so you can better reach your goals. That is when I decided to
          create MealCamp!
        </p>

        <p>
          MealCamp is an appliation which makes it easy for you to find high
          protien recipes and generate high protien weekly meal plans. MealCamp
          uses the <b>spoonacular recipe API</b> which has over 360 thousand
          recipes to choose from. I hope you like my application and find some
          delicious recipes that will help you reach your goals!
